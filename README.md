# Odin Recipes

This is a collection of recipes built as part of The Odin Project foundations course.  
It’s my first mini project using basic HTML, and soon I’ll add styling with CSS and functionality with JavaScript.

🍲 Simple structure  
💡 Beginner-friendly  
✨ My personal spin on each recipe

Stay tuned as this project evolves!
