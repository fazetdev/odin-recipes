<p>In Hausa, the name of this dish is <strong>tsire</strong>. It is printed in Hausaland and now found in every West African state.</p>

<h3>📖 Introduction</h3>
<p>Suya is a popular West African street food, especially beloved in Nigeria. It consists of thin slices of beef marinated in a unique blend of ground peanuts and spices (called <em>yaji</em>), then grilled to perfection over an open flame. It's spicy, flavorful, and often sold at roadside grills wrapped in old newspaper and served with onions and tomatoes. Suya is not just food — it's a social experience!</p>

<h3>🧂 Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>500g boneless beef (thinly sliced)</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons groundnut powder (roasted peanuts, finely ground)</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>

  <li>1 bouillon cube (crushed)</li>
  <li>Salt to taste</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
  <li>Skewers (wooden or metal)</li>
</ul>

<h3>🧑🏽‍🍳 Preparation</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Prepare the Beef:</strong><br>Wash and pat dry the beef.<br>Slice into thin, flat strips (cut against the grain for tenderness).</li>
  
  <li><strong>Mix the Suya Spice (Yaji):</strong><br>In a dry bowl, mix together groundnut powder, chili powder, garlic powder, ginger powder, bouillon cube, and a pinch of salt.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Marinate the Meat:</strong><br>Rub the spice mix generously on the beef slices.<br>Add a little vegetable oil and mix thoroughly.<br>Cover and refrigerate for at least 2–4 hours, or overnight for deeper flavor.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Skewer the Meat:</strong><br>Thread the marinated beef onto skewers, spreading it flat for even grilling.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Grill:</strong><br>Grill over hot charcoal, on a gas grill, or in an oven preheated to 180°C (356°F).<br>Grill each side for 5–7 minutes, basting with oil until golden brown and slightly charred.</li>
