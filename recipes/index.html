    <h2>Hausa Delights – A Taste of Tradition</h2>
    <img src="../images/tsire3.jpeg" alt="Tsire">
    
    <p><strong>Welcome to Hausa Delights</strong>, a simple yet rich journey into the flavors and spirit of Northern Nigeria. This project celebrates a selection of beloved Hausa recipes — meals that are not only delicious but deeply rooted in culture, memory, and community.</p>
    
    <p>From the fiery spice of <strong>Suya (Tsire)</strong> to the comforting softness of <strong>Wainar Shinkafa (Rice Pancake)</strong> and the savory depth of <strong>Dambun Nama</strong>, each dish tells a story. These are not just recipes — they are expressions of tradition, celebration, and daily life.</p>
    
    <p>These meals are served across Hausaland — at street corners, family gatherings, and festive occasions. With each bite, they bring a sense of home, identity, and pride.</p>
    
    <p>Whether you're discovering Hausa cuisine for the first time or reconnecting with your roots, this collection is meant to inspire and inform. Take your time, explore, and enjoy cooking up something both simple and special.</p>
