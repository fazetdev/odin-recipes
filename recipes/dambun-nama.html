    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>500g meat (cow, goat, sheep, or poultry – boneless)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ginger powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 onion (chopped)</li>
      <li>1–2 seasoning cubes</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground chili pepper (optional)</li>
      <li>1 cup finely chopped spinach, ugu, or moringa leaves</li>
      <li>½ cup sliced onions</li>
      <li>½ cup grated carrots (optional)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons groundnut oil or vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Boil the Meat:</strong> Cut the meat into large chunks. Add chopped onions, ginger, garlic, 
        seasoning cubes, and salt. Add a small amount of water and cook on medium heat until the meat becomes soft and tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shred the Meat:</strong> Remove the cooked meat and allow to cool slightly. Shred it finely using 
        fingers, a mortar and pestle, or a fork. Poultry may be easier to shred by hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Steam with Vegetables:</strong> In a dry pot or steamer, add the shredded meat. Mix in chopped 
        vegetables (spinach, carrots, sliced onions), ground pepper, and oil. Cover the pot tightly and steam 
        on low heat for 10–15 minutes. Use foil under the lid to trap steam for best results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stir and Finish:</strong> Stir well to combine the spices and vegetables. Let it rest for a few 
        minutes, then serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
